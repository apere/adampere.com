  | An aesthetic and philosophy of sound art is based on the discovering drive. 
  br
  | This is not a gnostic drive, but a drive to knowing. 
  br
  br
  | Knowing as past participle, 
  br
  | always now, 
  br
  | unfolding in the present, 
  br
  | bringing with it the uncertainty of a fleeting understanding. 
  br
  br
  | Such listening does not pursue the question of meaning, as a collective, total comprehension, but that of interpretation in the sense of phantasmagoric, individual and contingent practice. 
  br
  | This practice remains necessarily incomplete in relation to an objective totality but complete in its subjective contingency.
  br
  br
  | Sound narrates, 
  br
  | outlines, 
  br
  | and fills, 
  br
  | but it is always ephemeral and doubtful. 
  br
  br
  | Between my heard and the sonic object/phenomenon 
  br
  br
  | I will never know its truth 
  br
  br
  | but can only invent it, producing a knowing for me. This knowing is the experience of sound as temporal relationship. This ‘relationship’ is not between things 
  br
  | but is the thing, 
  br
  | is sound itself.
  br
  br
  | Listening cannot contemplate the object/phenomenon heard separate from its audition because the object does not precede listening.  Rather, the auditory is generated in the listening practice: 
  br
  br
  | in listening I am sound, 
  br
  | there can be no gap between the heard and hearing, 
  br
  | I either hear it 
  br
  | or I don’t, 
  br
  | and what I perceive is what I hear. 
  br
  br
  | I can perceive a distance 
  br
  | but that is a heard distance. 
  br
  br
  | The distance is what I hear here,
  br
  | not over-there. 
  br
  br
  | It does not signal a separation of objects or events but is the separation as perceived phenomenon
