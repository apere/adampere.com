        | As a creative technologist at Tellart, I worked on the team tasked with building the electronic components to Toyota's Concept-i prototype revealed at CES 2017. The project is the result of a 1.5-year collaboration with Toyota Research Institute, Calty, ICI and Tellart, working to imagine a future where vehicles form a true partnership with drivers and use AI to anticipate peopleâ€™s needs, inspire their imaginations, and improve their lives. My role in the team included designing the software system to coordinate visual effects inside the vehicle, testing materials and equipment, soldering components, etc.
